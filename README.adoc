ECIP-1017 (Monetary Policy) Testing tool
========================================

# Project Idea

ECIP-1017 https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1017.md

Emulate a lifecycle of a network of ETC nodes through few monetary supply eras and verify that network works
 as expected without interruptions and produces correct reward.

# Implementation

## Network

Run a network in a Google Cloud with Kubernetes. That allows to run testing by any 3rd party, it takes minutes to
 setup Google Cloud account and should cost less that a $100 for the full testing scenario.

Preconfigured network topology to cover most of real life edges:
 * Geth-Geth, Parity-Parity, Geth-Parity
 * fake Dapps to produces transactions
 * mining
 * loose connection between subnetworks

## Running

### Docker containers

All images are already prepared and deployed to Docker Hub registry. If you want to use custom modification then
 most simple way would be to deploy your custom images directly to Google Cloud Containers registry, you'll need to
 update names in `k18s/*.rc.yaml` and use `bin/build.sh`.

To use existing containers you don't need to do anything.

### Deploy

Run
```
bin/deploy.sh <GOOGLE_CLOUD_ID>
```

### Check status

```
bin/status.py
```

### Verify state

```
bin/verify.py
```
